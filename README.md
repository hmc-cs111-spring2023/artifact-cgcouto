# PyQuest: A DSL for creating text-based adventure games

Hi there! This is my project for CS 121 : Domain Specific Languages at Harvey Mudd College.

tldr: This is a language that lets you create simple text-based adventure games in an HTML-like syntax. 

Dependencies/packages needed: pyparsing (pip install should do the trick)

## Audience and intent

When I first learned HTML in eighth grade, I found it super boring. A language like this could fill the same need that HTML did when I was younger - teaching basic nesting, structure, and the importance of syntax.

## DSL overview

My DSL is heavily inspired by HTML/XML with its nesting and options. 

### Rooms

You can pass in multiple files at once, and my language will parse them all and stitch the game together. 

### Characters

### Items

### Other notes

My language has reasonable error-handling, both on the initial syntax and on game logic. 

## Running your game

## How to play

I've come to realize that the commands within the game are like a mini-DSL.
